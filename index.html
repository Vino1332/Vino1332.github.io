        <h1>Where The Wind Blows</h1>
        <p>The wind blows strong the wind blows high<br> <br>Where ever the wind blows the sky will always <strong> trail</strong> behind</p> <p> The leaves that grow dark and dim like a <strong> broken</strong> chance my vison becomes slim.</p> the leaves that <strong> soar</strong> through the night <p> the <strong> lost</strong> man lost his mind then lost his sight.</p> <p> when in doubt you can look into the sky</p> <p> closing your eyes <strong> wondering</strong> what it would be like to fly</p> <p> where here to mutiply then eventually pass and die</p> <p> story of life its the cycle that cant be unbroken</p> <p> only spoken</p>
